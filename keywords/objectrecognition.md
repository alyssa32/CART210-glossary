## Object Recognition

Object recognition is the ability to recognize objects from visual representations [^hummel13objectRecognition]. It also helps towards visual reasoning and inference. For example, a human visually recognising a hammer gives the individual more information about the object, such as what it is generally used for and what it approximately weighs [^hummel13objectRecognition]. This is a fundamental biological importance to humans, as well as animals for survival and to perform tasks [^logothetis96objectRecognition]. A human’s object recognition goes beyond the simple face-on point-of-view of an object, allowing them to recognize an object from a variety of angles and different lighting [^hummel13objectRecognition]. 

Similarly, there are recent technological developments which have given computers the ability to visually identify objects as well but to a certain extent [^brownlee21objectRecognition]. Object recognition is also a term used to describe computer vision identifying objects from a photograph or camera [^brownlee21objectRecognition]. A system is able to perform this task with the combination of object localization and image classification [^brownlee21objectRecognition]. Once a computer has recognized an object, it locates it with a bounding box [^brownlee21objectRecognition].
