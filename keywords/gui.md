## GUI (Graphical User Interface)

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is the interface of current computers. Usually portrayed as symbols, buttons, or pointing devices, to allow the user to easily communicate with a computer [^levy24gui]. A well designed GUI facilitates navigation, efficiency, and practicality of a software to the average computer user [^jansen98gui].

However, information was not always graphically displayed and as easy to navigate through as it is today. Early users would communicate with computers by “batch processing” (Reimer 2005, 3). They would write out all details of a task on punch cards then feed it to the computer which would return the results within an hour or more [^levy24gui]. The GUI concept originates from Douglas Engelbart, an electrical engineer and inventor, who envisioned a display system with graphical information which the user could jump around from [^reimer05gui]. It was not until 1962 that his ideas were published in an essay titled “Augmenting Human Intellect” and then developed the technology to present a public demonstration in 1968 [^reimer05gui]. Nearly 10 years later, Xerox Star was the first application created with a GUI design [^jansen98gui]. Steve Jobs caught wind of this development and hired some of the same designers to create Apple Lisa for Apple Computer [^jansen98gui]. These first designs were not commercially successful until Jobs’ project Apple Macintosh [^jansen98gui]. The GUI we see and use today strongly roots back to the GUI found in Macintosh.
