## GUI (Graphical User Interface)

GUIs, (Graphical User Interfaces) are the graphics displayed on a digital screen which show the user what actions they may take. [^juviler23gui] On a modern day phone, GUIs can be seen as icons for apps, menu bars and buttons on websites. A well designed GUI will make the user experience more efficient and easy to navigate through. [^bernard98gui] It is for this reason that software programs rely heavily on a good GUI design when it comes to their marketplace success. [^bernard98gui] 

However, graphical user interfaces were not always present when it comes to computers. Before GUIs, users would call actions using type text commands, known as character user interfaces (CUIs). [^juviler23gui] While being simple for programmers, this method was more on the complex side for the average user. This was until 1968 when Douglas Englebart had envisioned and demoed a display system with graphical information which allowed the user to perform tasks. [^reimer05gui]
